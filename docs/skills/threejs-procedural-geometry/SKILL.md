# Procedural Geometry

Generate geometry from a semantic contract and explicit coordinate frame.
Treat polygon operations as the design model and triangle emission as the final
compilation step. Do not declare an object complete until its topology,
assembly relationships, semantic measurements, and fixed views all pass.

This skill contains exemplary examples and assets beyond descriptive guidance,
they're worth studying, referencing, or even copying. Use them sufficiently
when relevant and do NOT blindly skip them.

## Craft loop

1. Define units, local/world frames, dimensions, bounds, primary profiles,
   topology intent, shell thickness, apertures, material slots, and triangle
   band.
2. Declare every required contact, support, clearance, penetration, reveal,
   moving envelope, and interaction datum.
3. Choose a modeling operation for each visible form: profile extrusion, inset,
   loft, revolve, sweep, direct-topology aperture, solidify, subdivision,
   bevel, or fillet.
4. Keep quads and n-gons through design. Preserve one named mesh per semantic
   part; do not weld unrelated parts or merge material slots yet.
5. Apply modifiers in a deliberate order, then clean inside each part, repair
   winding, assign a part-specific smooth angle, and emit triangles.
6. Run the polygon topology gate, then audit the named world assembly for
   coplanar overlap, defects, and substantial solid clashes.
7. Run builder-owned semantic checks, including support, openings, shell
   thickness samples, ergonomic clearances, and moving extrema.
8. Merge by material slot, audit again, and inspect fixed silhouettes, hidden
   sides, joints, interaction views, wireframe, normals, and grazing light.

## Modeling bar

- Use primitives only for genuinely primitive or hidden structural parts.
- Give every visible manufactured edge a scale-appropriate bevel or fillet.
- Build openings into one closed shell; do not stack a dark plane over a solid.
- Construct thick shells with paired profiles or `solidify`; never rely on a
  single surface where an exposed rim reveals thickness.
- Drive mating parts from the same datum. A late visual nudge is a failed
  dimension contract.
- Choose a continuous mesh for a continuous manufactured form. An arrangement
  of intersecting primitives is not a substitute for modeling.
- Keep narrow, named allowances only for intersections that are structurally
  intentional.

## Portable JavaScript kit

Place the complete `assets/geometry-quality-kit/` directory into a Three.js
project when the project lacks an equivalent modeling and quality layer.
Adjust import paths and scene plumbing as needed; preserve the geometry and
audit contracts.

- [procedural-mesh.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/procedural-mesh.js) provides
  `MeshData`, polygon cleanup, winding reconstruction, profiles, offsets,
  extrusion, loft, revolve, sweeps, solidify, subdivision, bevels, apertures,
  smooth-angle normals, material-slot builds, and Three.js emission.
- [mesh-topology-audit.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/mesh-topology-audit.js)
  checks loose/duplicate vertices, degenerates, open/non-manifold edges,
  detached components, signed volume, and emitted positions/normals.
- [geometry-audit.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/geometry-audit.js) audits a
  built `Object3D` hierarchy for true clipped coplanar overlap, invalid mesh
  data, missing materials, and substantial triangle-crossing clashes.
- [geometry-contract.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/geometry-contract.js)
  runs object-specific measurements without imposing project-specific shape
  semantics.
- [assembly.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/assembly.js) preserves named parts
  for auditing, then builds one draw mesh per material slot after gates pass.
- [selftest.js](assets/geometry-quality-kit/selftest.js) plants known defects
  and verifies the modeling, topology, contract, assembly, z-fight, and clash
  paths; run it after placing or adapting the kit.

## Failure conditions

- same-facing coplanar triangles survive at a visible scale;
- a loose vertex, degenerate face, open solid, non-manifold edge, detached
  component, invalid normal, or inward closed volume reaches emission;
- substantial unrelated solids intersect, or a placed part lacks a declared
  support/contact relationship;
- an exposed shell is paper-thin or an aperture is a visual overlay;
- a visible primitive keeps razor edges or joins another primitive without a
  designed transition;
- profile frames flip, caps share smooth side normals, or UV density changes
  with segment count;
- material merging happens before named-part auditing;
- triangle count is the only complexity evidence;
- a script passes but fixed-view inspection still finds implausible modeling.
- a complete humanoid is reduced to intersecting capsules and boxes;
- mirrored hands or limbs keep inward winding;
- high-frequency object-space material noise is emitted without footprint filtering.

## Routing boundary

This skill owns reusable mesh construction and geometry quality. Use
`$threejs-procedural-materials` when surface identity is primary,
`$threejs-procedural-architecture` for a building grammar, and
`$threejs-procedural-vegetation` for a growth hierarchy; those subject skills
may then apply these geometry mechanisms.
