# Geometry craft workflow

Use this reference to replace primitive assembly with a polygon-first modeling
process, explicit part relationships, deliberate edge treatment, and a staged
definition of done. Use metres for the numeric defaults below or scale all
dimensions and audit tolerances together.

## Semantic geometry contract

Write a contract before vertices. Keep it beside the builder so the same
dimensions drive geometry, placement, interaction, and audit measurements.

```js
const contract = {
  frame: "+X length, +Y back, +Z up; ground at Z = 0",
  unit: "metre",
  bounds: { width: 1.8, depth: 0.52, height: 0.98 },
  parts: {
    frame: { topology: "closed-solid", material: "cast" },
    slat: { topology: "closed-solid", material: "metal" },
  },
  joins: [
    { a: "slat:*", b: "rail:*", relation: "clearance", min: 0.012 },
    { a: "foot:*", b: "ground", relation: "support", gap: 0 },
  ],
  triangleBand: [2500, 10000],
};
```

Record at least:

- authoring frame, world frame, origin, and unit;
- overall bounds and the primary silhouette/profile dimensions;
- whether every part is a closed solid, thick shell, or intentional surface;
- shell thickness, aperture, reveal, and clearance requirements;
- required contacts, supports, intended penetrations, and forbidden overlaps;
- moving-part extrema and swept-volume clearance;
- stable names, material slots, and expected part/triangle bands;
- the views needed to verify silhouette, hidden sides, joins, and interaction.

Do not re-derive a mating dimension in two builders. Compute both parts from
one datum, endpoint, profile, or layout constant.

## Polygon-first design model

Keep quads and n-gons during design. Triangles are a rendering representation,
not the modeling language. Use `MeshData` from
`assets/geometry-quality-kit/procedural-mesh.js` to retain polygon ownership
through transforms and modifiers.

```js
import {
  cleanMesh,
  loft,
  recalcNormals,
  smoothShade,
  toGeometry,
} from "./geometry-quality-kit/procedural-mesh.js";

const part = loft(sectionRings, {
  closeV: true,
  capStart: true,
  capEnd: true,
});
cleanMesh(part);
recalcNormals(part);
smoothShade(part, 34);
const geometry = toGeometry(part);
```

The module authors Z-up and emits Three.js Y-up once. The conversion
`(x, y, z) -> (x, z, y)` has negative determinant, so emission reverses face
winding while converting positions and normals.

Use smooth-by-angle per-corner normals. A corner averages only adjacent faces
whose face normals remain within the part's crease threshold. Do not replace
this with an unrestricted `computeVertexNormals()` pass.

`cleanMesh()` uses an actual Euclidean weld test across neighboring spatial
cells; a quantized cell key alone is insufficient because two vertices within
the weld distance can straddle a cell boundary. `toGeometry()` preserves
per-vertex color attributes and compiles consecutive `faceMat` values into
Three.js geometry groups.

## Modeling operation selection

Choose the operation that owns the visible form:

| Form | Primary operation |
| --- | --- |
| constant section | profile extrusion / `prism*` |
| changing section | `loft` over authored rings |
| axial body, fastener, vessel | `revolve` with welded poles |
| rail, pipe, cable, frame | `tubeAlong`, `sweepPlanarLoop`, or `runMolding` |
| opening through a solid | `panelWithHoles`, `wallRun`, or `aperturedPrism` |
| hollow rim or casing | `hollowPrism` or `annularPrism` |
| rounded manufactured block | `roundedBoxMesh` or provenance-aware `bevel` |
| thin designed skin | profile pairs or `solidify` with explicit thickness |

Treat primitives as acceptable only when the intended form is genuinely a
primitive or the part is hidden structure. A visible housing assembled from a
box, cylinder, and sphere still owes a unified profile, edge hierarchy, and
plausible junctions.

Prefer direct topology for apertures. A frame built from matched outer/inner
rings owns its opening, jambs, end faces, and bevels in one closed shell. Reach
for general boolean machinery only when a direct ring or segmented-wall
construction cannot express the cut reliably.

## Modifier and emission order

Use this order unless the object's construction demands a stated exception:

```text
semantic profiles and rings
→ extrusion / inset / loft / revolve / sweep
→ solidify
→ subdivision where the design needs it
→ bevel or fillet
→ cleanup inside each part
→ winding repair and smooth-angle assignment
→ topology audit
→ triangle emission
```

Modifier order changes the object. Solidifying after beveling creates a
different rim from beveling a thick shell. Cleaning before a deliberate
modifier can remove topology it expects; cleaning after joining unrelated
parts can weld a butt joint into accidental geometry.

Use the metre-scale bevel bands as starting classes, not one universal radius:

```text
hardware / hinges / casings     0.002 m
panel / shelf / slat edges      0.004 m
carcass / plinth / cast stone   0.007 m
frame / apron / machine body    0.013 m
soft upholstered form           0.045 m
```

Common smooth-angle starting points are `40°` for turned parts, `34°` for
moulded sections, `45°` for shells, `38°` for cast forms, `50°` for tight
rolls, and `32°` for broad tops. Inspect the actual highlight before accepting
the value.

## Join and assembly discipline

Keep one `MeshData` per semantic part. Do not join separate components before
their relationship audit: cleanup can weld intended butt joints and material
merging can erase the names needed to diagnose an overlap.

Use these readable join floors:

```text
applied detail proud of host    >= 0.0008 m
intentional reveal              0.0015–0.006 m
gap meant to read at 2 m        >= 0.004 m
```

Flush but unrelated faces are forbidden. Choose one of four explicit states:

1. One continuous polygon mesh.
2. A declared structural penetration with a narrow named allowance.
3. A proud part with a readable offset.
4. A reveal or open gap.

Build named audit meshes first with `buildNamedAuditGroup()`. After the named
assembly passes, build one draw mesh per material slot with
`buildMergedAssembly()`, then run the scene audit again because same-slot
merging can contain coplanar triangles inside one mesh. Named audit parts must
have unique stable names; duplicate names fail assembly construction rather
than merging unrelated evidence under one label.

## Detail and geometry budgets

Allocate segments by visible radius and camera distance:

```text
radius <= 0.025 m       10–14 segments
radius <= 0.100 m       16–24 segments
radius >= 0.150 m       28–48 segments for player-adjacent forms
```

Report both part count and triangle count. Triangle count alone cannot expose
an object made from hundreds of independent primitives, and part count alone
cannot expose an over-tessellated hero surface.

Spend topology on silhouette, aperture shape, edge highlights, and contact
points before hidden planar faces. Add the small parts that explain assembly—
fasteners, collars, gussets, pads, seams—only after the primary form and joins
are correct.

## Visual inspection contract

Mechanical checks cannot decide whether a form is plausible or well modeled.
Inspect at least:

- front, rear, both sides, top, underside, and opposing three-quarter views;
- orthographic silhouette views;
- close views of every join, aperture, shell edge, and cap;
- interaction-height views such as seated eye, standing eye, or boarding view;
- both extrema and intermediate poses of moving geometry;
- grazing light, clay material, material-slot colors, wireframe, and normal or
  face-orientation diagnostics.

Look specifically for primitive seams, implausible load paths, unsupported
parts, hidden-side defects, paper-thin openings, unrounded manufactured edges,
and trim that floats when viewed from behind.

## Observed limitations and defects

- A closed manifold shell can still be the wrong shape.
- Bounding-box overlap is not proof of triangle collision.
- A generic support ray cannot understand suspended, wall-mounted, or hanging
  parts without declared support targets.
- Shell thickness cannot be inferred reliably for every arbitrary mesh; assert
  generator-owned thickness samples or construct the shell with `solidify`.
- Cleaning a combined assembly can weld parts that must remain independent.
- A global bevel radius destroys scale hierarchy.
- Smooth shading across caps and side walls rounds edges that should remain
  exact.
- A broad collision allowance hides defects; every allowed pair needs stable
  names and a construction reason.

## Diagnostics

Keep a build report with:

```text
part count / triangle count / material slots
per-part topology reports
named-assembly z-fight and clash reports
post-merge z-fight report
semantic contract measurements
fixed-view capture list
```

Print actual measured values beside expected ranges. A bare pass/fail hides
whether a clearance is comfortably valid or one floating-point step from the
boundary.

## Failure diagnosis

- Faceted curve: raise profile/ring resolution before adding subdivision.
- Soft hard edge: lower the smooth angle or split cap/side ownership.
- Inside-out solid: repair winding from signed volume before emission.
- Floating component: fix the shared datum or declared support relationship;
  do not visually nudge the part downward.
- Z-fight: remove one face, join topology, or create a proud/revealed relation.
- Collision false positive at a butt joint: verify true penetration depth
  before adding a narrow named allowance.
- Defect appears only after merging: inspect same-slot parts that lost their
  individual object boundary.
